/***************************************************************************
 * 
 * Instructions for changing the used UIDs and capabilities:
 *
 * 1) Copy the file custom-config.h.template to some location _outside_ 
 *    the mysql directory hierarchy (that way you can later easily take a 
 *    newer mysql into use).
 *
 * 2) Make the necessary modifications in that copied file.
 *
 * 3) Remove the comments around the include below.
