- chartables.c is generated using dftables.exe

- dftables.exe is compiled using either the Microsoft or the CodeWarrior
  compilers.

It just proved too difficult to make this work from within the Symbian
build system.

So, do as follows if chartables.c needs to be regenerated.

- Copy pcre.hs to pcre.h
- Copy config.hs to config.h

- [cl|mwccsym2].exe -I. dftables.c

- dftables chartables.c

- Delete pcre.h and config.h
