// On EKA2 there are two kinds of toolchains - one building according to
// abiv1 and another one building according to abiv2. These abi's are
// linktime incompatible, but the generated binaries are runtime
// compatible.
//
// Built DLLs and their import libraries have different names and can
// thus be built using the same SDK, but static libraries, although
// also incompatible, have the same name and thus effectively prevent
// you from building static libraries with gcce (abiv2) and armv5 (abiv1) 
// using the same SDK.
//
// The use of these macros ensure that the names are different.
//

//
// NOTE: The check should be based on whether gcce _or_ armv5_abiv2
//       is used, but there is no(?) way for detecting whether
//       armv5 or armv5_abiv2 is used.
