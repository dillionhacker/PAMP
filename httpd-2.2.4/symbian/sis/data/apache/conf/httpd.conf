#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/> for detailed information.
# In particular, see 
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/directives.html>
# for a discussion of each configuration directive.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "C:/Data/Apache" will be interpreted by the
# server as "c:/data/apache/logs/foo.log".
#
# NOTE: Where filenames are specified, you must use forward slashes
# instead of backslashes (e.g., "c:/apache" instead of "c:\apache").
# If a drive letter is omitted, the drive on which Apache.exe is located
# will be used by default.  It is recommended that you always supply
# an explicit drive letter in absolute paths, however, to avoid
# confusion.
#


#
# Performance and Resource Consumption
#
# The following settings affect the performance and resource
# consumption of the server:
#
#     ThreadLimit
#     MinSpareThreads
#     MaxSpareThreads
#     StartThreads
#     MaxRequestsPerThread
#     ThreadStackSize
#     MaxMemFree
#

# 
# ThreadLimit: The maximum number of threads, i.e. the maximum
# number of _concurrently_served_ clients.
#
#  Min:      1
#  Max:     16
#  Default:  4
#
# NOTE: If mod_php is loaded, then the ThreadLimit will
#       always be adjusted down to 1, as PHP is currently 
#       not MT compatible.
#
#ThreadLimit 4

#
# MinSpareThreads: The minimum number of spare threads, i.e. idle
# threads that can handle sudden request spikes. If the number of
# idle threads drops below this value, then more will be created.
#
#  Min:      1
#  Max:      Value of ThreadLimit - 1
#  Default:  1
#
# The default value of 1 means in practice that unless the maximum
# number of threads has been fixed at 1, there will always be at
# least 2 threads.
#
#MinSpareThreads 1

#
# MaxSpareThreads: The maximum number of spare threads, i.e. idle
# threads that can handle sudden request spikes. If the number of
# idle threads grows above this number, then threads will be killed.
#
#  Min:      1
#  Max:      Value of ThreadLimit - 1
#  Default:  1
#
# The default value of 1 means in practice that unless the maximum
# number of threads has been fixed at 1, there will always be at
# least 2 threads.
#
#MaxSpareThreads 1

#
# StartThreads: The number of threads that should be started at
# startup.
#
#  Min:     1
#  Max:     Value of ThreadLimit
#  Default: 1
# 
#StartThreads 1

#
# MaxRequestsPerThread: The maximum number of requests a thread may 
# handle before it should exit. A new thread is created in its stead.
#
#  Min:     0      (no upper limit)
#  Max:     maxint
#  Default: 0
#
#MaxRequestsPerThread 0

#
# ThreadStackSize: The stacksize (in BYTES) of each thread handling
# client connections.
#
#  Default: 0
#
# The default value of 0 means that the system default is used.
# Currently the default is 0x10000.
#
#ThreadStackSize 0

#
# MaxMemFree: The maximum number of free KILOBYTES that the
# allocators are allowed to hold before freeing the memory.
#
#  Default: 0   (no limit)
#
# Without a limit, the amount of memory reserved by Apache can
# only grow, but never shrink.
#
#MaxMemFree 0

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to point the LockFile directive
# at a local disk.  If you wish to share the same ServerRoot for multiple
# httpd daemons, you will need to change at least LockFile and PidFile.
#
ServerRoot "c:/data/apache"

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "On" to deactivate.
#
# NOTE: See AlwaysUseBlockingIO below.
#
KeepAlive Off

#
# AlwaysUseBlockingIO: This Symbian specific directive specifies whether
# blocking IO should always be used or not.
#
# Default is On, that is, blocking IO is always used. The reason is that
# there appears to be some issues with non-blocking IO that in some
# contexts causes problems.
#
# If you want to experiment with having KeepAlive On, you must set 
# AlwaysUseBlockingIO to Off as otherwise every request will cause the 
# server to hang for a period as long as the timeout.
#
#AlwaysUseBlockingIO On

#
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or
# ports, instead of the default. See also the <VirtualHost>
# directive.
#
# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to 
# prevent Apache from glomming onto all bound IP addresses (0.0.0.0)
#
#Listen 12.34.56.78:80
Listen 80

# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support

# to be loaded here.

# 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

#
# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
#
ServerAdmin unknown@unknown.com

#
# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# This you can change into the "domain name" of your phone.
