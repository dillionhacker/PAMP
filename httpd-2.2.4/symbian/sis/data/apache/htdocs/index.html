    <p>
      This website probably resides on a <i>regular</i> 
      <a href="http://www.nokia.com/phones">Nokia S60 phone</a> 
      and is powered by the world's most widely used web server - 
      <a href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache</a>. The Internet visibility 
      is provided by a transparent gateway that provides a mobile phone 
      with a <i>global name</i> in the operator networks of today.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apache documentation can be found 
      <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/">here</a> 
      but please note that not all functionality is available on this 
      platform.

      Now, finally, the mobile phone becomes a full member of the web!
